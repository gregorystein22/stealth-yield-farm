# 🌱 Stealth Yield Farm

> **"Farm in Privacy, Reap in Public"** 🌾

A revolutionary DeFi platform that combines traditional yield farming with cutting-edge privacy technology. Your farming strategies remain encrypted until harvest, protecting you from copycat whales and MEV attacks.

## 🚀 Why Stealth Yield Farm?

In traditional DeFi, your profitable strategies are visible to everyone, allowing whales to copy your moves and front-run your positions. **Stealth Yield Farm** changes this game entirely.

### 🛡️ Privacy-First Approach
- **Encrypted Positions**: Your farming data is encrypted using FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)
- **Invisible Strategies**: Competitors can't see your positions until you withdraw
- **MEV Protection**: Advanced protection against Maximal Extractable Value attacks
- **Whale-Proof**: Large players can't copy your profitable strategies

### 🌾 Agricultural Metaphor
Just like a real farmer who keeps their best techniques secret until harvest, our platform protects your DeFi strategies until you're ready to reveal them.
