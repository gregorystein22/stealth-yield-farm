# üîê Security Guide for Stealth Yield Farm

This document outlines security best practices for deploying and using Stealth Yield Farm.

## üö® Critical Security Requirements

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit sensitive data** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Keep private keys secure** and never share them publicly
- **Rotate API keys regularly** for enhanced security

### Private Key Management
- **Use hardware wallets** for production deployments
- **Never store private keys** in plain text files
- **Use secure key management** services in production
- **Consider multi-signature wallets** for enhanced security

## üîß Configuration Security

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Blockchain Configuration
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
VITE_RPC_URL_BACKUP=https://1rpc.io/sepolia

# Wallet Connect
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID

# API Keys
VITE_INFURA_API_KEY=YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY

# Contract Address
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

### Hardhat Configuration
```bash
# For contract deployment
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_API_KEY
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Development
1. **Use test networks** for development and testing
2. **Never use mainnet** private keys in development
3. **Use separate wallets** for different environments
4. **Regular security audits** of smart contracts

### Production Deployment
1. **Use environment variables** in deployment platforms
2. **Enable HTTPS** for all production deployments
3. **Use secure RPC endpoints** with authentication
4. **Monitor for suspicious activity**

### Smart Contract Security
1. **Audit contracts** before mainnet deployment
2. **Use established libraries** like OpenZeppelin
3. **Implement access controls** and role-based permissions
4. **Test thoroughly** on testnets before mainnet

## üîç Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All sensitive data removed from code
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Private keys secured and not in code
- [ ] API keys rotated and secured
- [ ] Smart contracts audited
- [ ] Testnet deployment successful

### After Deployment
- [ ] Monitor for unusual activity
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## üö® Incident Response

### If Compromise Suspected
1. **Immediately rotate** all API keys and private keys
2. **Pause contract operations** if necessary
3. **Notify users** of potential security issues
4. **Document the incident** for analysis
5. **Implement additional security measures**

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Deploy new contracts** with updated security
2. **Migrate user funds** to secure contracts
3. **Update frontend** to use new contract addresses
4. **Communicate changes** to users

## üìû Security Contacts

For security-related issues:
- **Email**: security@stealthyieldfarm.com
- **GitHub Issues**: Use private security advisories
- **Discord**: #security channel

## üîÑ Regular Security Updates

- **Monthly**: Review and rotate API keys
- **Quarterly**: Security audit of smart contracts
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security review
- **As needed**: Security patches and updates
